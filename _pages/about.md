Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Virginia G. Rodriguez and I am a fourth year PhD Candidate at the University of Notre Dame. As a scientist, I have been fortunate enough to participate in a wide range of research projects, from aqueous geochemistry to mass spectrometry and uranium geochemistry. Through my experiences, I have developed a deep passion for science and a desire to share my knowledge and insights with others.

One of the reasons I created this website is to introduce myself and provide information about how to get in touch with me. Whether you are a fellow scientist, a potential collaborator, or simply someone with a keen interest in the natural world, I would love to hear from you.

In addition to my research, I am also deeply committed to mentoring and teaching the next generation of scientists. I believe that education and outreach are essential for fostering an appreciation and understanding of the natural world.

Ph.D. Projects
======

As a doctoral student, I have had the opportunity to work on three research projects related to the field of chemistry and radiochemistry. 

My first project involves studying the ionization of uranyl peroxide aqueous solutions using Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The aim of this project is to gain a better understanding of the behavior of uranyl peroxide ions in and the factors that affect their ionization. The results of this project could potentially lead to the development of new analytical techniques for detecting uranium compounds.

My second project focuses on characterizing uranyl peroxide nanoclusters in the gas phase using tandem mass spectrometry with collision-induced dissociation. The goal of this project is to obtain detailed information about the structure and composition of these nanoclusters, which could potentially lead to the development of new materials for nuclear waste management and uranium extraction.

Finally, my third project involves studying the mobility of uranium and radium from a uranium mine in New Mexico using a gamma spectrometer. The aim of this project is to better understand the environmental impact of uranium mining. The results of this project could have important implications for the understanding of environmental mining at a specific site.

Overall, my research projects have focused on the study of uranium compounds and their behavior in different contexts.
